## Junior Frontend Engineers (Beginner)

### State Management

Implement a counter component with React's useState hook.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will create a simple counter component using React's `useState` hook. The goal is to familiarize yourself with React hooks and managing component state. Your counter component should increment and decrement a count value when buttons are pressed.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a basic React project using Create React App  
[ ] Create a functional React component  
[ ] Use the `useState` hook to manage the count state  
[ ] Implement increment and decrement functionality  
[ ] Display the current count value in the component

### Simple Middleware

Create a simple logging middleware for an Express application.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will create a simple logging middleware for an Express application. The middleware should log basic information about incoming requests, such as the method and URL, to the console. This task will help you understand how to create middleware and where to place it in your Express app.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a basic Express API if you don't already have one  
[ ] Create a logging middleware that logs request details  
[ ] Apply the middleware to your Express app  
[ ] Ensure the middleware logs information for every incoming request  
[ ] Test your middleware by making sample requests to the server

### Custom Hooks

Create a custom hook for fetching data from an API in React.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will create a custom hook in React to fetch data from an API. The custom hook will help you encapsulate and reuse the logic for data fetching, making your components cleaner and more maintainable. This task will help you to improve your skills in writing reusable hooks and managing API calls.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a React project and create a custom hook file  
[ ] Implement the logic to fetch data from an API within the custom hook  
[ ] Use the fetch state to manage loading and error states  
[ ] Use your custom hook in a functional component  
[ ] Render the data retrieved from the API in the component

## Senior Backend Engineers (Intermediate)

### Caching with Redis

Integrate Redis to cache responses in an Express application.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will integrate Redis into your Express application to cache responses for frequently accessed endpoints. This will improve the performance and scalability of your API by reducing the load on your database. This task will help you learn about caching mechanisms and how to integrate Redis with Node.js.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a Redis server and install the Redis package for Node.js  
[ ] Connect your Express application to the Redis server  
[ ] Implement caching logic for specific endpoints  
[ ] Handle cache invalidation to ensure data consistency  
[ ] Test your caching implementation by making requests to the server

### Advanced Testing

Write comprehensive end-to-end tests using Cypress.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will write comprehensive end-to-end tests for a React application using Cypress. End-to-end tests help ensure that the app functions correctly from the user's perspective. This task will enhance your skills in writing robust tests, debugging test failures, and ensuring application reliability.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up Cypress in your React project  
[ ] Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows  
[ ] Use Cypress commands to interact with the UI  
[ ] Assert expected outcomes, such as changes in the DOM or Redux state  
[ ] Run your tests and debug any issues that arise

## Staff Backend Engineers (Advanced)

### CI/CD Pipeline

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js project using GitHub Actions and deploy to a cloud provider.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js project using GitHub Actions. The pipeline will automatically run tests, build the project, and deploy it to a cloud provider like AWS or Heroku. This task will help you understand how to automate the software delivery process and ensure consistent, reliable deployments.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Create a new GitHub Actions workflow for your Node.js project  
[ ] Configure the workflow to run tests and build the project  
[ ] Set up deployment steps to your chosen cloud provider  
[ ] Securely manage credentials and secrets for deployment  
[ ] Monitor and troubleshoot any issues with the CI/CD pipeline

### Problem Title: Performance Optimization

Optimize a React component by memoizing with `React.memo` and using `useCallback`.

**Problem Description:**

In this challenge, you will focus on optimizing a React component's performance. The key is to use `React.memo` for memoizing functional components and `useCallback` for memoizing callback functions. This exercise will help you understand how to identify unnecessary re-renders and how to optimize them, leading to more efficient and performant React applications.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Create a React component that renders a list of items
[ ] Identify areas causing unnecessary re-renders
[ ] Use `React.memo` to optimize functional components
[ ] Implement `useCallback` to memoize callback functions
[ ] Test the optimizations to ensure improved performance

### Problem Title: Database Transactions

Implement transaction support for database operations in MySQL using Sequelize.

**Problem Description:**

In this challenge, you will implement transaction support for database operations in a MySQL database using Sequelize. Transactions are crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially when performing multiple related operations that should either all succeed or all fail. You will learn how to use Sequelize to manage transactions and ensure that your database operations are atomic and consistent.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a MySQL database and integrate it with a Node.js project using Sequelize
[ ] Create a Sequelize model and define relationships between models
[ ] Implement a transaction that encompasses multiple database operations
[ ] Handle transaction commit and rollback scenarios
[ ] Test your transaction implementation using sample data and edge cases

## Junior Frontend Engineers (Beginner)

### Simple To-Do List

Create a basic to-do list using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will build a simple to-do list application. The goal is to practice the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your to-do list should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This problem will help you understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic styling.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Create an HTML structure with input field and buttons
[ ] Style the to-do list using CSS
[ ] Add tasks dynamically using JavaScript
[ ] Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed
[ ] Implement functionality to delete tasks

### Basic CRUD API

Create a basic CRUD REST API using Node.js and Express.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will create a simple RESTful API that performs basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a list of items. You will use Node.js and Express to set up your server and create RESTful routes for each of the CRUD operations. This will help you understand the fundamentals of building APIs and handling HTTP requests in Express.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a Node.js project and install Express
[ ] Create RESTful routes for CRUD operations
[ ] Implement handlers for each route (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
[ ] Use in-memory storage to manage the list of items
[ ] Test your API using a tool like Postman

### Advanced State Management

Build a React application using Redux for state management.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you'll create a React application that uses Redux for state management. The application will be a more advanced version of a to-do list, complete with the ability to filter tasks by their status (all, active, completed). This problem will help you solidify your understanding of managing complex application state and using Redux best practices.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a React project with Create React App
[ ] Install and configure Redux and React-Redux
[ ] Create actions and reducers for adding, completing, and deleting tasks
[ ] Implement filtering of tasks by status using Redux state
[ ] Connect your Redux store to your React components

### Advanced Error Handling

Implement advanced error handling with custom error classes and middleware in Express.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will enhance an existing Express application by adding advanced error-handling mechanisms. You'll create custom error classes to handle different kinds of errors and middleware to manage these errors gracefully. This problem will help you implement robust and maintainable error-handling strategies in your applications.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Create custom error classes for different types of errors (e.g., NotFoundError, ValidationError)
[ ] Implement middleware to catch and handle these errors
[ ] Ensure your API responses include meaningful error messages and status codes
[ ] Test your error-handling logic using unit tests
[ ] Document your error-handling strategy

## Staff Frontend Engineers (Advanced)

### Micro Frontends

Design and implement a micro-frontend architecture for a complex application.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will design and implement a micro-frontend architecture where different parts of a large application are built and deployed independently. This problem will help you explore the benefits of micro-frontends, such as scalability and maintainability, and understand how to integrate them seamlessly using techniques like Module Federation in Webpack or Web Components.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Break down a large application into smaller, independent frontends
[ ] Implement one part of the application as a standalone micro-frontend
[ ] Configure module federation or Web Components for seamless integration
[ ] Ensure consistent styling and state management across micro-frontends
[ ] Deploy micro-frontends independently and integrate into a single application

## Staff Backend Engineers (Advanced)

### Microservices with Nest.js

Design and implement microservices architecture using Nest.js.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will design and implement a microservices architecture using the Nest.js framework. You will split a monolithic application into multiple microservices that communicate with each other over HTTP or a message broker like RabbitMQ. This will help you understand the intricacies of microservices, such as inter-service communication, service discovery, and scalability.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a Nest.js project
[ ] Design a monolith application and identify components for microservices
[ ] Split the application into multiple Nest.js microservices
[ ] Implement inter-service communication using HTTP or RabbitMQ
[ ] Ensure each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently

## Junior Frontend Engineers (Beginner)

### Simple React Component

Create a React component that displays a list of items.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will create a simple React component that displays a list of items passed to it as props. The goal is to practice how React works with components and props, and to gain familiarity with the basics of JSX. This task will help cement your understanding of component-based architecture in React.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a basic React project using Create React App
[ ] Create a functional React component
[ ] Pass a list of items to your component as props
[ ] Display the list of items within your component using JSX
[ ] Style your component using CSS

## Junior Backend Engineers (Beginner)

### Basic Authentication

Implement Basic Authentication for an Express API.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will enhance your Express API by implementing Basic Authentication. This will involve adding middleware that checks the `Authorization` header of incoming requests and verifies credentials. This task will help you understand authentication mechanisms and middleware in Express.js.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a basic Express API if you don't already have one
[ ] Create middleware to parse the `Authorization` header
[ ] Verify credentials against a known username and password
[ ] Restrict access to protected routes based on authentication
[ ] Return appropriate status codes and messages for unauthorized requests

### Unit Testing

Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will write unit tests for a set of React components using Jest and React Testing Library. The goal is to ensure your components behave as expected under various conditions. This task will help you understand how to write effective tests and ensure the robustness of your application.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library in your React project
[ ] Write unit tests for your components' rendering logic
[ ] Test different states and props of the components
[ ] Mock external dependencies, if any
[ ] Ensure high test coverage for your components

## Senior Backend Engineers (Intermediate)

### Advanced Authentication

Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication using Passport.js.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will implement OAuth 2.0 authentication in an Express application using Passport.js. You will configure an OAuth2 strategy to authenticate users with a third-party provider like Google or GitHub. This task will help you understand OAuth 2.0 flows and how to secure an application using third-party authentication.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up Passport.js in your Express project
[ ] Configure OAuth2 strategy for a third-party provider
[ ] Implement the authentication routes and callback handling
[ ] Secure your API endpoints with OAuth2 authenticated sessions
[ ] Handle user sessions securely and manage user data

## Staff Frontend Engineers (Advanced)

### State Machines

Implement a complex UI state management using XState in a React application.

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will integrate XState into a React application to manage complex UI state. XState allows you to model state machines and statecharts, making it easier to manage the state that has multiple transitions. This task will help you understand deterministic state management and improve the predictability of your UI.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Set up a React project and install XState
[ ] Define state machines for complex state logic
[ ] Integrate XState with React components
[ ] Handle transitions and actions in your components
[ ] Debug and visualize state machines using XState tools

---

## Staff Backend Engineers (Advanced)

### Advanced Caching Strategies

Implement advanced caching strategies (e.g., cache invalidation, distributed caching).

**Problem Description:**

In this exercise, you will implement advanced caching strategies to optimize the performance of a backend service. You will explore techniques such as cache invalidation, distributed caching using Redis, and strategies like write-through and write-back caching. This task will help you understand the trade-offs and best practices in caching.

**Checklist:**

[ ] Integrate a caching library like Redis into your Node.js application
[ ] Implement basic caching for frequently accessed data
[ ] Set up cache invalidation rules to ensure data consistency
[ ] Explore different caching strategies like write-through and write-back
[ ] Profile and measure the performance impact of your caching strategy
